          I started playng Flight Rising again with a group of friends and found a few gaps in supporting tools for the game. Although various sites, Google sheets, 
          and forum posts existed as guides, there was no central hub that had it all.</p>
          <p>I made Guardian, named after a popular dragon breed on the site, to satisfy the helper tools I found myself needing while I played.</p>
